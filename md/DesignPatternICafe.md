**1. What are the main categories of design patterns?**  
- Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, enhancing flexibility and reuse.  
- Structural patterns focus on object composition, simplifying relationships between entities.  
- Behavioral patterns address object collaboration and responsibility delegation.  
- Examples include Singleton (Creational), Adapter (Structural), and Observer (Behavioral).  
- I used Behavioral patterns in an event-driven project to manage communication between objects using the Observer pattern. Example:  

```csharp
public class ObserverExample
{
    public interface IObserver { void Update(string message); }
    public class Subject
    {
        private List<IObserver> observers = new List<IObserver>();
        public void AddObserver(IObserver observer) => observers.Add(observer);
        public void NotifyObservers(string message)
        {
            observers.ForEach(o => o.Update(message));
        }
    }
}
```

**2. What is a design pattern and why should anyone use them?**  
- A design pattern is a proven, reusable solution to a common software design problem.  
- They improve communication by providing shared terminology.  
- Using them promotes code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.  
- In my .NET Core API project, Singleton ensured a single instance of a logger, optimizing resource usage. Example:  

```csharp
public sealed class Logger
{
    private static readonly Logger instance = new Logger();
    private Logger() {}
    public static Logger Instance => instance;
    public void Log(string message) { Console.WriteLine(message); }
}
```

---

**3. What is a pattern in software design?**  
- A pattern is a general reusable solution to a recurring problem.  
- Itâ€™s not a finished design but a template for solving problems.  
- Patterns guide developers to write optimized and clean code.  
- In an Angular project, I used patterns to structure reusable services and components effectively.  

---

**4. What is the Singleton design pattern?**  
- Ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.  
- Provides a global point of access to that instance.  
- It is useful for managing shared resources like configuration or logging.  
- Implemented Singleton for database connections in my project, reducing overhead. Example:  

```csharp
public sealed class DatabaseConnection
{
    private static readonly DatabaseConnection instance = new DatabaseConnection();
    private DatabaseConnection() { }
    public static DatabaseConnection Instance => instance;
}
```

---

**5. What is Dependency Injection?**  
- A technique to achieve Inversion of Control by providing dependencies externally.  
- It decouples the creation of an object from its usage.  
- Promotes testability and easier maintenance.  
- Used Dependency Injection in .NET Core using built-in support to inject services into controllers. Example:  

```csharp
public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public void Execute() { /* Implementation */ }

```csharp
public abstract class ReportTemplate
{
    public void GenerateReport() { FetchData(); FormatReport(); SaveReport(); }
    protected abstract void FetchData();
    protected abstract void FormatReport();
    protected void SaveReport() { Console.WriteLine("Saving Report..."); }

public class PDFExport : IExportStrategy { public void Export(string data) { /* Export to PDF */ } }
```

**16. What is Inversion of Control?**  
- A design principle where the control of object creation and flow is transferred from the program to a framework or container.  
- Helps decouple the code by abstracting dependencies.  
- Implemented using Dependency Injection, Service Locators, or Events.  
- In .NET Core, IoC is achieved through the built-in Dependency Injection container. Example:

{
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    public ProductRepository(DbContext context) { _context = context; }
    public Product GetById(int id) => _context.Products.Find(id);
}
```

---

**18. Can we create a clone of a Singleton object?**  
- Technically, it is possible but violates the Singleton principle.  
- Using reflection or serialization can bypass Singleton constraints.  
- This is generally discouraged as it defeats the purpose of Singleton.  
- Prevented cloning in a project by implementing `ICloneable` and throwing an exception. Example:  

```csharp
public class Singleton : ICloneable
{
    private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    private Singleton() { }
    public static Singleton Instance => instance;
    public object Clone() => throw new NotSupportedException("Cloning not allowed.");

}
```

---

**21. What is the Claim Check pattern in Azure Event Grid?**  
- A messaging pattern to offload payloads from messages and replace them with references (claims).  
- Reduces message size, improving performance and scalability.  
- Claims are used to retrieve the full payload from storage when needed.  
- Used this to handle large messages efficiently in a distributed system. Example:  

```json
{
    "eventType": "PayloadReference",
    "data": {
        "url": "https://storage.blob.core.windows.net/container/message.json"

}
```

---

**32. In OOP, what is the difference between the Repository pattern and a Service Layer?**  
- The Repository pattern handles data access and persistence logic.  
- The Service Layer contains business logic and coordinates operations across repositories.  
- Repositories focus on CRUD operations, while services orchestrate workflows.  
- Used Service Layer in conjunction with Repository to encapsulate business rules. Example:  

```csharp
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IRepository<Order> _repository;
    public OrderService(IRepository<Order> repository) { _repository = repository; }
    public void PlaceOrder(Order order) { /* Business logic */ _repository.Add(order); }
}
```

---

**33. Is Unit of Work equal to Transaction or is it more than that?**  
- Unit of Work coordinates changes across multiple repositories in a single transaction.  
- Transactions are low-level, while Unit of Work is higher-level and manages multiple operations.

**60. What would you choose: a Repository pattern or "smart" business objects?**  
- Repository pattern for clear separation of data access and domain logic.  
- Smart business objects for simpler, self-contained applications.  
- Repository scales better for large systems, while smart objects are quick for prototypes.  
- Chose Repository for an enterprise app requiring complex query handling.  

**61. Could you explain some benefits of the Repository pattern?**  
- Simplifies data access logic by providing a clean abstraction layer.  
- Promotes testability by allowing mock implementations.  
- Centralizes database access, reducing duplication across codebases.  
- Implemented this pattern to streamline data access in a multi-layered web application.

**62. Could you explain the difference between Facade and Mediator patterns?**  
- Facade simplifies access to a complex subsystem by providing a unified interface.  
- Mediator manages communication between multiple objects without them knowing about each other.  
- Facade is about reducing system complexity; Mediator focuses on object interaction.  
- Used Facade for API calls and Mediator for event-driven workflows in projects.

**63. What is the difference between Template and Strategy patterns?**  
- Template defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring steps to subclasses.  
- Strategy defines a family of algorithms and allows them to be interchangeable.  
- Template enforces structure; Strategy promotes flexibility.  
- Used Template for defining report generation steps and Strategy for dynamic payment methods.

**64. What is the Deadly Diamond of Death in design patterns?**  
- Refers to ambiguity in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor.  
- Common in languages that support multiple inheritance (e.g., C++).  
- Avoided in languages like C# or Java by using interfaces or composition.  
- Resolved this issue in a C++ project by ensuring proper virtual inheritance.  

---

**65. Could you explain the differences between Facade, Proxy, Adapter, and Decorator design patterns?**  
- **Facade**: Simplifies access to a subsystem by providing a single interface.  
- **Proxy**: Controls access to an object (e.g., caching, logging).  
- **Adapter**: Converts an interface into another compatible interface.  
- **Decorator**: Dynamically adds behavior to an object without altering its structure.  
- Applied these patterns in different scenarios: Facade for API, Proxy for caching, Adapter for legacy systems, and Decorator for runtime extensions.

**66. Can we use CQRS without Event Sourcing?**  
- Yes, CQRS can be implemented without Event Sourcing.  
- Event Sourcing is optional and records changes as events; CQRS separates reads and writes.  
- Often used together but not inherently dependent on each other.  
- Implemented CQRS with traditional database reads in a reporting tool without Event Sourcing.  

---

**67. What's the difference between Dependency Injection and Service Locator patterns?**  
- Dependency Injection provides dependencies explicitly, while Service Locator allows components to fetch them.  
- DI promotes explicit dependencies and is more transparent.  
- Service Locator can lead to hidden dependencies and harder-to-trace code.  
- Switched from Service Locator to DI in a .NET Core project for better testability.  

---

**68. How should I add an object into a collection maintained by an Aggregate Root?**  
- Use a method on the Aggregate Root to encapsulate the operation.  
- This ensures business rules are enforced during object addition.  
- Direct manipulation of collections violates the Aggregate's consistency boundary.  
- Example from an e-commerce project:  

```csharp
public class Order
{
    private readonly List<OrderItem> _items = new();
    public void AddItem(OrderItem item) => _items.Add(item); // Enforce rules here
}
```

---

**69. What is the Data Mapper pattern?**  
- Maps data between in-memory objects and a database while keeping them independent.  
- Promotes decoupling between domain logic and database schemas.  
- Used by tools like Entity Framework and Hibernate.  
- Example:  

```csharp
public class DataMapper
{
    public Order MapToOrder(DataRow row) => new Order { Id = (int)row["Id"], Name = (string)row["Name"] };
}
```

---

**70. What is the Repository and Specification pattern combination?**  
- Specification defines criteria for querying data, and Repository implements data access.  
- This combination simplifies complex queries and keeps them reusable.  
- Used to filter orders dynamically in a .NET application. Example:  

```csharp
public class OrderSpecification
{
    public Expression<Func<Order, bool>> Criteria { get; } = order => order.IsPaid;
}
```

---

**71. What is a Domain Event in DDD?**  
- Represents something that happened in the domain that is significant to business.  
- Often used to trigger side effects or notify other parts of the system.  
- Encapsulates changes to the state in an immutable event object.  
- Example:  

```csharp
public class OrderPlacedEvent
{
    public int OrderId { get; }
    public OrderPlacedEvent(int orderId) { OrderId = orderId; }
}
```

---

**72. What is the Repository pattern in CQRS?**  
- Provides separate repositories for queries and commands.  
- Query repositories focus on read operations, and command repositories focus on writes.  
- Promotes clarity and scalability in CQRS implementations.  
- Example structure: `OrderQueryRepository`, `OrderCommandRepository`.  

---

**73. What is an Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)?**  
- Translates between different models or systems to maintain domain integrity.  
- Prevents external systems from polluting the internal domain model.  
- Used to integrate a legacy billing system with a modern payment service.  
- Example:  

```csharp
public class BillingAcl
{
    public ModernBillingRequest ConvertToModernRequest(LegacyBillingData legacyData) { /* Mapping logic */ }
}
```

---

**74. What is the purpose of a Value Object in DDD?**  
- Represents an immutable type defined by its attributes, not identity.  
- Promotes consistency and encapsulates logic related to attributes.  
- Used for reusable concepts like money, address, or date range.  
- Example:  

```csharp
public class Money
{
    public decimal Amount { get; }
    public string Currency { get; }
    public Money(decimal amount, string currency) { Amount = amount; Currency = currency; }
}
```

---

**75. What is a bounded context in Domain-Driven Design?**  
- Represents a logical boundary within which a domain model is consistent.  
- Defines clear separations of concerns between subdomains.  
- Reduces complexity by isolating models and logic.  
- Used bounded contexts to structure a microservices-based application.
