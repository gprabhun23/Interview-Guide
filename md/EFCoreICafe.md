**Q1: What are the benefits of using EF?**  
- Entity Framework simplifies database access and management by abstracting database queries and updates into LINQ-based operations.  
- It eliminates the need for most of the boilerplate code associated with ADO.NET or raw SQL queries, saving development time.  
- EF integrates seamlessly with different database systems, making switching or scaling easier.  
- Example: In a project, I used EF to handle CRUD operations without writing SQL, allowing rapid changes to the data model through migrations.  
```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var product = new Product { Name = "Laptop", Price = 1000 };
    context.Products.Add(product);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

**Q2: What is Entity Framework?**  
- Entity Framework (EF) is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for .NET developers.  
- It enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects instead of SQL queries.  
- EF supports multiple approaches, including Code First, Database First, and Model First, to model data.  
- Example: I used EF Code First to create a database dynamically from C# classes in an e-commerce project.  
```csharp
public class Product 
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

**Q3: What is Conceptual Model?**  
- The Conceptual Model in EF represents the high-level view of the data structure as entities and relationships.  
- It is part of the EDMX file and defines entities, their properties, and associations.  
- It abstracts away the database-specific details and focuses on the domain model.  
- Example: In one project, I customized the Conceptual Model to include computed properties like FullName for User entities.  

**Q4: What is Mapping?**  
- Mapping in EF refers to the process of linking the conceptual model to the storage model.  
- It connects classes and properties in the domain model to database tables and columns.  
- The mapping can be configured through Data Annotations, Fluent API, or the EDMX file.  
- Example: I used Fluent API to map a composite key in the OrderDetails table in an inventory system.  
```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<OrderDetail>()
    .HasKey(od => new { od.OrderId, od.ProductId });
```

**Q5: What is pluralize and singularize in the Entity Framework?**  
- Pluralize means converting entity names to their plural forms when generating table names (e.g., `Product` becomes `Products`).  
- Singularize converts table names back to singular forms when creating entities.  
- These features help maintain consistency between domain classes and database tables.  
- Example: In my project, I enabled pluralization to ensure consistent table naming conventions across the database schema.  

**Q6: What is the purpose of a DbContext class?**  
- The DbContext class is the primary class in EF for interacting with the database.  
- It manages database connections and tracks changes to entities for saving data.  
- DbContext provides APIs for querying and saving data using LINQ.  
- Example: I used DbContext to fetch and update customer orders in a retail management system.  
```csharp
using (var context = new RetailDbContext())
{
    var orders = context.Orders.Where(o => o.Status == "Pending").ToList();
}
```

**Q7: What is migration in Entity Framework?**  
- Migrations in EF are a feature to incrementally update the database schema while preserving existing data.  
- They are used in the Code First approach to apply schema changes via code.  
- Migrations generate C# files containing database commands for schema changes.  
- Example: I used migrations to add a new column to the Products table during a feature upgrade.  
```bash
Add-Migration AddDescriptionToProducts
Update-Database
```

**Q8: Mention in what all scenarios Entity Framework can be applicable?**  
- CRUD operations in data-driven applications.  
- Applications requiring a high level of abstraction over database queries.  
- Multi-database support where switching providers is necessary.  
- Example: I implemented EF in a logistics application to support multiple databases (SQL Server and PostgreSQL) seamlessly.  

**Q9: What are scalar and navigation properties in Entity Framework?**  
- Scalar properties map directly to database columns, representing primitive data types.  
- Navigation properties link entities and enable navigation between related data.  
- Scalar properties represent fields like `Name` or `Price`, while navigation properties represent relationships like `Category` or `Orders`.  
- Example: I used navigation properties in a blogging platform to load related posts and comments.  

**Q10: Mention what is Code First Approach and Model First Approach in Entity Framework?**  
- Code First Approach defines the model in code, and the database schema is generated from these classes.  
- Model First Approach uses a visual designer to define the model, generating the database schema and code from it.  
- Code First is more flexible for developers comfortable with coding, while Model First is better for visually-oriented schema design.  
- Example: I used Code First for rapid prototyping and Model First for a fixed schema in a corporate database.  

**Q11: What is Code First approach in Entity Framework?**  
- The Code First approach uses C# classes to define the domain model.  
- EF generates the database schema based on these classes and their configurations.  
- It supports migrations for schema changes without manual intervention.  
- Example: I used Code First to build a dynamic catalog system for an online store.  

**Q12: What is Storage Model?**  
- The Storage Model in EF represents the database structure, including tables, columns, keys, and relationships.  
- It is part of the EDMX file and reflects the actual database schema.  
- The Storage Model is mapped to the Conceptual Model through mappings.  
- Example: I adjusted the Storage Model to include custom indexing for frequently queried columns.  

**Q13: How can we handle concurrency in Entity Framework?**  
- Use a concurrency token column to track changes and detect conflicts.  
- Implement optimistic concurrency by checking row versions during updates.  
- Handle `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` in code to manage conflicts.  
- Example: I used concurrency tokens to handle simultaneous updates in a multi-user accounting application.  

**Q14: Explain Lazy Loading, Eager Loading, and Explicit Loading?**  
- Lazy Loading loads related data when accessed for the first time.  
- Eager Loading loads related data along with the primary entity query.  
- Explicit Loading loads related data explicitly via code after the primary query.  
- Example: I used Eager Loading to reduce query count in a report generation module.  

**Q15: Could you explain the difference between Optimistic vs Pessimistic locking?**  
- Optimistic locking assumes no conflicts and checks for changes at update time.  
- Pessimistic locking prevents conflicts by locking data during access.  
- Optimistic is better for read-heavy scenarios; Pessimistic is used in write-heavy or critical data scenarios.  
- Example: I implemented Optimistic Locking to handle edits in a collaborative document editing tool.  
```csharp
try
{
    context.SaveChanges();
}
catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException ex)
{
    // Handle conflict
}
```
**Q16: What are POCO classes in Entity Framework?**  
- POCO (Plain Old CLR Objects) classes are simple C# classes without any EF-specific base classes or attributes.  
- They represent the domain model and are used to maintain the separation of concerns.  
- POCO classes are lightweight, making them testable and easier to maintain.  
- Example: In a blogging platform, I used POCO classes for entities like `Post` and `Comment` to maintain a clean domain model.  
```csharp
public class Post 
{
    public int PostId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Comment> Comments { get; set; }
}
```

**Q17: What is Optimistic Locking?**  
- Optimistic Locking allows multiple users to access a resource but detects conflicts when saving changes.  
- It uses a concurrency token, like a version number or timestamp, to check for changes.  
- This approach is suitable for applications with low conflict probability.  
- Example: I used Optimistic Locking in an inventory system to prevent stock updates from overwriting each other.  

**Q18: What are complex types in Entity Framework?**  
- Complex types are non-scalar properties of an entity that map to multiple columns in a table.  
- They cannot have keys and are always embedded within an entity.  
- Complex types are used to group related fields for better organization.  
- Example: I used a complex type `Address` for entities like `Customer` and `Supplier` to avoid redundancy.  
```csharp
public class Address
{
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string PostalCode { get; set; }
}
```

**Q19: What are the different approaches supported in the Entity Framework to create Entity Model?**  
- Code First: Define the model in code and generate the database schema.  
- Database First: Start with an existing database and generate the model.  
- Model First: Design the model visually and generate the database schema and code.  
- Example: I used Database First for a legacy system integration project to quickly scaffold the database schema.  

**Q20: What is EF Data Access Architecture?**  
- EF Data Access Architecture involves the layers of the application that interact with the database through EF.  
- The architecture includes the domain model, DbContext, LINQ queries, and database provider.  
- It abstracts data access logic, promoting separation of concerns.  
- Example: In a multi-tenant application, I used a layered architecture with EF to manage tenant-specific data.  

**Q21: Can you explain Lazy Loading in a detailed manner?**  
- Lazy Loading defers the loading of related data until it is accessed for the first time.  
- It uses proxy objects to intercept property calls and load data dynamically.  
- Lazy Loading can lead to performance issues if not managed properly (e.g., N+1 queries).  
- Example: In a forum application, Lazy Loading was used for comments to load them only when viewed by the user.  

**Q22: What are the advantages and disadvantages of Database First Approach?**  
- Advantages: Suitable for existing databases, provides a clear starting point, and minimizes initial setup effort.  
- Disadvantages: Less flexibility for model customizations and requires database changes for schema updates.  
- Database First is ideal for integrating with legacy databases.  
- Example: I used Database First for an HR system to work with an established database schema.  

**Q23: What are the advantages of Model First Approach?**  
- Visual design of models allows for easier collaboration with non-technical stakeholders.  
- Automatically generates the database schema and code from the model.  
- Provides a centralized view of the data structure.  
- Example: I used Model First to design and deploy a database for a project management tool.  

**Q24: What is Eager Loading?**  
- Eager Loading loads related entities as part of the initial query.  
- It uses the `Include` method to specify the relationships to load.  
- Eager Loading reduces query count but may fetch unnecessary data.  
- Example: In an order tracking system, I used Eager Loading to fetch orders and their associated products in one query.  
```csharp
var orders = context.Orders.Include(o => o.Products).ToList();
```

**Q25: What is the role of Entity Client Data Provider?**  
- It serves as a bridge between the Entity Framework and the underlying database provider.  
- Converts LINQ queries to database-specific SQL queries.  
- Facilitates communication between the Conceptual Model and the Storage Model.  
- Example: I used Entity Client Data Provider to support cross-database operations in a hybrid environment.  

**Q26: What are the components of Entity Framework Architecture?**  
- Conceptual Model: Represents the high-level view of the data.  
- Storage Model: Represents the database schema.  
- Mapping: Links the conceptual and storage models.  
- Example: I worked on an EDMX file in an analytics system to configure these components for complex queries.  

**Q27: Explain how you can load related entities in EF?**  
- Use Lazy Loading for on-demand loading.  
- Use Eager Loading with the `Include` method to load related data in the initial query.  
- Use Explicit Loading to load related data explicitly in code.  
- Example: I used Explicit Loading to fetch related customer data in a billing system only when needed.  

**Q28: What is the importance of EDMX file in Entity Framework?**  
- EDMX (Entity Data Model XML) file contains the Conceptual Model, Storage Model, and Mapping.  
- It serves as a blueprint for the database and model relationships.  
- EDMX files are essential for Model First and Database First approaches.  
- Example: I modified an EDMX file to add navigation properties in a legacy reporting system.  

**Q29: What are the advantages/disadvantages of Code First Approach?**  
- Advantages: Highly flexible, allows use of migrations, and no dependency on the database schema.  
- Disadvantages: Initial setup requires more effort and knowledge of EF configurations.  
- Ideal for greenfield projects or rapid prototyping.  
- Example: I used Code First for a healthcare system to dynamically evolve the database schema during development.  

**Q30: When would you use EF6 vs EF Core?**  
- Use EF6 for mature projects requiring full feature support and compatibility with .NET Framework.  
- Use EF Core for lightweight, high-performance, and cross-platform applications.  
- EF Core is better for new projects with modern requirements.  
- Example: I chose EF Core for a cross-platform mobile app to leverage its performance and flexibility.  

**Q31: Which type of loading is good in which scenario?**  
- Lazy Loading: Best for small, infrequent, or on-demand data access scenarios.  
- Eager Loading: Ideal for scenarios where related data is always needed to avoid additional queries.  
- Explicit Loading: Useful when data requirements vary and are loaded selectively.  
- Example: In an online store, Eager Loading was used for frequently accessed product categories and their details.  

**Q32: Can you explain CSDL, SSDL, and MSL sections in an EDMX file?**  
- **CSDL (Conceptual Schema Definition Language):** Defines the conceptual model, including entities and relationships.  
- **SSDL (Store Schema Definition Language):** Represents the database schema, including tables and columns.  
- **MSL (Mapping Specification Language):** Maps the conceptual model to the storage model.  
- Example: I customized MSL to map a composite key to a domain model in a logistics application.  

**Q33: What are T4 templates?**  
- T4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) templates are code generation tools used in EF to generate classes based on the model.  
- They generate entity classes, DbContext, and other supporting code.  
- T4 templates can be customized to fit specific project requirements.  
- Example: I modified a T4 template to include custom logging in entity classes for an auditing system.  

**Q34: Is DbContext thread-safe?**  
- DbContext is not thread-safe and should not be shared across threads.  
- Each thread or operation should have its own instance of DbContext.  
- Using DbContext in a multi-threaded environment may lead to unexpected behaviors.  
- Example: I ensured a separate DbContext instance for each API request in a RESTful service.  

**Q35: How can you enhance the performance of Entity Framework?**  
- Use `AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries to avoid change tracking overhead.  
- Optimize queries with LINQ and avoid loading unnecessary data.  
- Batch updates and inserts to minimize database round-trips.  
- Example: I used `AsNoTracking()` in a dashboard application to improve performance for large dataset queries.  
```csharp
var products = context.Products.AsNoTracking().ToList();
```

**Q36: What is the difference between ObjectContext and DbContext?**  
- DbContext is a simpler and lightweight API introduced in EF 4.1 for easier use.  
- ObjectContext is the older, more complex API with additional features like ObjectStateManager.  
- DbContext supports modern patterns like dependency injection and LINQ directly.  
- Example: I migrated a legacy project from ObjectContext to DbContext for better readability and performance.  

**Q37: What is faster - ADO.NET or ADO.NET Entity Framework?**  
- ADO.NET is faster due to its lower-level operations and minimal abstraction overhead.  
- EF provides productivity and maintainability benefits at the cost of some performance.  
- ADO.NET is ideal for performance-critical applications, while EF suits business applications.  
- Example: I used ADO.NET for batch data processing but EF for standard CRUD operations in a CMS.  

**Q38: Name some differences between Express vs Recoverable messages.**  
- Express messages are stored in memory and faster but not durable.  
- Recoverable messages are stored on disk, ensuring durability and reliability.  
- Express messages are suitable for high-performance, non-critical applications.  
- Example: I used recoverable messages in a financial transaction system to ensure data integrity.  

**Q39: What types of system-generated messages do you know?**  
- System-generated error messages for exceptions or invalid operations.  
- Log messages for tracking application or system behavior.  
- Audit trail messages to record user or system actions.  
- Example: I used system-generated log messages to monitor API calls in a microservices architecture.  

**Q40: Why shouldn't I use the Repository Pattern with Entity Framework?**  
- EF already acts as a repository by providing DbSet for managing entities.  
- Adding another repository layer can lead to redundancy and unnecessary complexity.  
- It may hinder EF's advanced features like LINQ and change tracking.  
- Example: I avoided a custom repository pattern in an EF project to simplify data access and leverage EF's capabilities.  

**Q41: What is the relationship between Repository and Unit of Work?**  
- The Repository handles CRUD operations for a specific entity.  
- The Unit of Work manages transactions and tracks changes across multiple repositories.  
- Together, they provide a cohesive way to manage data access and ensure consistency.  
- Example: I used both patterns in a modular application to decouple business logic from data access.  

**Q42: What are the disadvantages of using static DbContext?**  
- It may lead to memory leaks due to retained connections and untracked entities.  
- Not thread-safe, causing issues in multi-threaded applications.  
- Difficult to test and manage lifecycle in large applications.  
- Example: I replaced a static DbContext with dependency injection for a scalable web application.  

**Q43: What is the difference between POCO, Code First, and simple EF approach?**  
- POCO: Focuses on plain CLR objects without EF dependencies.  
- Code First: Generates a database from domain classes and migrations.  
- Simple EF: Typically involves Database First or EDMX-driven development.  
- Example: I used POCO with Code First to create a clean and flexible data layer in a project.  

**Q44: Could you explain Pessimistic locking?**  
- Pessimistic locking locks a resource when it is accessed to prevent concurrent modifications.  
- It ensures data integrity in high-contention environments but may cause performance issues.  
- Pessimistic locking is achieved using transactions or specific SQL locking hints.  
- Example: I used `FOR UPDATE` in a banking application to prevent overdraft issues during concurrent withdrawals.  

**Q45: What’s the difference between LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework?**  
- LINQ to SQL only supports SQL Server, while EF supports multiple databases.  
- EF offers features like Code First, migrations, and navigation properties, which LINQ to SQL lacks.  
- LINQ to SQL is simpler but less flexible compared to EF.  
- Example: I migrated a LINQ to SQL project to EF for PostgreSQL compatibility and improved scalability.  

**Q46: What is the difference between Code First, Model First, and Database First?**  
- Code First starts with C# classes and generates the database.  
- Model First uses a visual designer to create the model and database.  
- Database First scaffolds the model and code from an existing database.  
- Example: I used Database First for integrating an existing ERP system with minimal disruption.  

**Q47: How can we do pessimistic locking in Entity Framework?**  
- Use explicit SQL queries or stored procedures with locking hints like `WITH (ROWLOCK, UPDLOCK)`.  
- Execute raw SQL commands using `context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand`.  
- Ensure transactions are managed to avoid deadlocks.  
- Example: I implemented pessimistic locking in EF to secure inventory updates during a flash sale.  

**Q48: What is the difference between Automatic Migration vs Code-based Migration?**  
- Automatic Migrations apply schema changes without requiring migration scripts.  
- Code-based Migrations involve writing migration scripts for fine-grained control.  
- Automatic Migrations are faster but less precise than Code-based Migrations.  
- Example: I used Code-based Migrations in a production app to version-control schema changes.  

**Q49: What difference does `.AsNoTracking()` make?**  
- Disables change tracking, improving performance for read-only operations.  
- Reduces memory overhead for queries involving large datasets.  
- Ideal for scenarios where the entities won’t be updated.  
- Example: I used `.AsNoTracking()` for read-only dashboards to reduce query execution time.  

**Q50: What are the advantages and disadvantages of creating a Global Entities Context for the application?**  
- Advantages: Centralized access to data, simplifying configuration.  
- Disadvantages: High memory usage, potential data inconsistency, and thread-safety issues.  
- Not suitable for large or multi-threaded applications.  
- Example: I replaced a global context with a scoped DbContext in a microservices-based project.  

**Q51: When would you use `SaveChanges(false)` + `AcceptAllChanges()`?**  
- Use `SaveChanges(false)` to save changes without affecting the state of tracked entities.  
- Call `AcceptAllChanges()` explicitly to mark entities as unchanged after manual operations.  
- Useful in scenarios where custom transaction handling is required.  
- Example: I used this approach in a batch processing system to commit changes in chunks.  

**Q52: What is client wins and store wins mode in Entity Framework concurrency?**  
- **Client Wins:** Overwrites database values with client changes in case of a conflict.  
- **Store Wins:** Discards client changes and retains database values.  
- These modes are used to resolve concurrency conflicts.  
- Example: I applied Store Wins in a ticket booking system to prioritize server-side accuracy.  

**Q53: What’s the difference between `.SaveChanges()` and `.AcceptAllChanges()`?**  
- `.SaveChanges()` persists changes to the database and marks entities as unchanged.  
- `.AcceptAllChanges()` only updates the state of entities without saving to the database.  
- Typically, `.SaveChanges()` calls `.AcceptAllChanges()` internally.  
- Example: I used `.AcceptAllChanges()` in a custom transaction rollback handler.  

**Q54: Can I use Entity Framework 6 in .NET Core?**  
- EF6 can be used in .NET Core, but EF

 Core is preferred for better performance and features.  
- EF6 is suitable when migrating legacy apps to .NET Core without changing data access logic.  
- Example: I used EF6 in a .NET Core app to leverage an existing EDMX model during migration.  

**Q55: How do you handle multiple DbContexts in a single application?**  
- Use dependency injection to configure multiple DbContexts with different lifetimes.  
- Ensure each DbContext handles distinct parts of the domain or database.  
- Example: I managed multiple DbContexts in a multi-tenant app, each pointing to a tenant-specific database.

**Q56: What is a shadow property in Entity Framework Core?**  
- Shadow properties are not defined in the entity class but exist in the EF Core model.  
- They are primarily used for audit fields like CreatedDate or UpdatedDate.  
- Access shadow properties using the EF Core ChangeTracker or raw queries.  
- Example: I used shadow properties to track entity modification timestamps without cluttering domain models.  
```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().Property<DateTime>("LastUpdated");
```

**Q57: What are the features of Entity Framework Core 6?**  
- Supports many-to-many relationships without explicit join tables.  
- Improved performance for LINQ queries and data seeding.  
- Introduced compiled models for faster startup times.  
- Example: I utilized EF Core 6's compiled models in a high-throughput API to reduce latency.  
```csharp
var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<MyDbContext>()
    .UseModel(compiledModel)
    .Options;
```
